# Soil Properties Calculator

This repository contains a Soil Properties Calculator in the (`.tns`) format. Texas Instruments are fuckwits who think it's cool to charge like $70 a year for access to their dogshit software just to be able to put python scripts on a calculator. Yeaaaaah, I'm thinking get fucked. So a portable command-line converter called ***Luna*** was used to convert Lua and Python scripts to TNS TI-Nspire documents. You can find this gem at [(https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Luna)]. Given that I haven't really followed the rules, I can't import any libraries or use any efficient syntax methods, so the python code is pretty scuffed, but it works.

1. **Python version (`.py`)** - A script for running the calculations on a PC, which I wouldn't bother doing, just whip out chatgpt bruz.
2. **TI-Nspire CX II CAS version (`.tns`)** - A version compatible with the TI-Nspire CX II CAS calculator.

## Features
- Computes various soil properties such as bulk density, void ratio, porosity, degree of saturation, and more.
- Allows users to input known values while leaving unknowns blank for automatic calculation.
- Provides multiple calculation passes to ensure interdependent properties are resolved.

## Python Usage
Idk, just download the code and run it. Or repo it idc

## Installation & Usage (TI-Nspire CX II CAS) ( CX II OS 5.2 or later).

### Steps:

1. **Transfer the File**
   -  Scroll up and you will see three files: Read me, (`.py`) and (`.tns`). You are going to want to click into the (`.tns`) file. From there, download the raw file and it should automatically download in a (`.tns`) format. This is the file you are going to install into your calculator
   - Connect your TI-Nspire CX II CAS calculator to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the TI-Nspire Computer Link webapp found at: [(https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-nspire-cx-ii-connect)]
   - Drag and drop the `.tns` file into the calculator's directory.

3. **Run the Program**
   - On your calculators home screen click browse and navigate to the folder where you transferred the `.tns` file
   - Open the file, hit menu, run, run. This will then run the script. Follow on-screen instructions to input values and compute soil properties.

> **Note:** Use this tool as a guide for soil property calculations. Don't be a dumb cunt and use this in an exam.
