# Soil Properties Calculator

This repository contains a Soil Properties Calculator implemented in two formats:

1. **Python version (`.py`)** - A script for running the calculations on a PC.
2. **TI-Nspire CX II CAS version (`.tns`)** - A version compatible with the TI-Nspire CX II CAS calculator.

## Features
- Computes various soil properties such as bulk density, void ratio, porosity, degree of saturation, and more.
- Allows users to input known values while leaving unknowns blank for automatic calculation.
- Provides multiple calculation passes to ensure interdependent properties are resolved.
## Python Usage
Idk, just download the code and run it. Or repo it idc

## Installation & Usage (TI-Nspire CX II CAS)
Honestly don't know or care what operating system works atm, but mine is working, so all goods.
### Steps:

1. **Transfer the File**
   - Okay, listen up. Scroll up and you will see three files: Read me, ('.py') and ('.tns'). You are going to want to click into the ('.tns') file. From there, download the raw file and it should automatically download in a .tns format. This is the file you are going to -     - install into your calculator
   - Connect your TI-Nspire CX II CAS calculator to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the TI-Nspire Computer Link webapp found at: [(https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-nspire-cx-ii-connect)]
   - Drag and drop the `.tns` file into the calculator's directory.

3. **Run the Program**
   - On your calculators home screen click browse and navigate to the folder where you transferred the `.tns` file
   - Open the file, hit menu, run, run. This will then run the script. Follow on-screen instructions to input values and compute soil properties.

> **Note:** Use this tool as a guide for soil property calculations, and always verify results where necessary.
